A library for the execution of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus][\pi-calculus]] workflows, particularly those constructed by the WorkflowFM Reasoner using persistent (serializable) state.

This is part of the [[https://github.com/workflowfm/][WorkflowFM]] framework for correct-by-construction process and resource workflows.

* Modules

In addition to the core \pi-calculus model and execution engine, a list of additoinal modules are provided:

- *pew-mongo*: Additional executor that stores the state in a [[https://www.mongodb.com/][MongoDB]] database.
- *pew-kafka*: Additional executor that stores the state and open process calls in [[https://kafka.apache.org/][Kafka]] topics, yielding a fully persistent/completely stateless execution.
- *pew-simulator*: Integration with [[https://github.com/workflowfm/proter][Proter]], an expressive, asynchronous process simulator.
- *skiexample*: Deployment of an example ski purchasing workflow documented in [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.2348][this paper]].

* Install

Requirements:
- Java 8, Scala 2.12.12
- [[https://www.scala-sbt.org/][sbt]] v1.3.13

Installation is manual (at least for now) using ~sbt publishLocal~.

This will publish PEW in a local ivy repository.

You can then add it as a dependency in your own project.

e.g. in sbt: 
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
libraryDependencies += "com.workflowfm" %% "pew" % "1.5.0"
#+END_SRC
